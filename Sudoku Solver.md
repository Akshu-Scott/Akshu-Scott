Problem Statement - Implementing a code that solves a 9 X 9 sudoku board . This can also be called as a Sudoku Solver.
Problem of Choosing Algorithm - The first step that is always necessary to approach a probem like this is simply making an outline of the steps
                                that we will follow to solve our problem but the steps we choose must also be efficient. The Immediate approach 
                                that I thought of was to :
Approach 1 ( I call this The OBVIOUS ONE )
1) Find all the possiblities of filling the board with numbers between 1 and 9.
2) Now that the board is filled .
3) Return the board that is valid in sudoku.

Now that we have put up the approach ,however it seems to be very bad in terms of efficiency . This is because of the lengthy process and computations involved 
in the algorithm ,the number of ways that the sudoku board can be filled is estimated to take an exponential form of a very high value . In a nutshell this algorithm is 
not efficient at all which will be our conclusion. 
An algorithm has to be developed in a way that it offers high efficiency and that is how the quality of that algorithm is measure by,
so to achieve this target we have to deduce another approach to solve our problem .

So.....THE ALGORITHM ! 
I have uploaded the code for a sudoku solver , the algorithm was really confusing for my mind to even process it the first time , so it took me 8 views after which the algorithm 
started making sense to my brain. I just hope you find the code useful. I am still working to complete this description and explanation as soon as possible .
